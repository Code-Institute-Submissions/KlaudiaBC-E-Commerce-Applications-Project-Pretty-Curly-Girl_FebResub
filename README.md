## **Agile Scrum**
### **Planning Phase**
Pretty Curly Girl is an exciting business which provides hair products designed for curly hair treatments.
Hannah - the owner of the store (further called: *Client*), has asked me for a demo of an e-commerce application for her online sales - as she has been using the shopify services and while her business has grown, those services seem to not be satisfactory anymore.
At first, I have become familiar with the mission of her business, the products and mainly the actual website she uses to provide online sales. I have listed all components she has used and UX issues I have found as a potential customer.
Then, I have discussed those aspects with the Client and proceeded with brainstorm sessions, which over a time have brought the final results.
In this file I have documented all insights, ideas and the obstacles we have met together with my Client. I have also followed the Agile Scrum and built basic marketing strategy for e-commerce purposes.

Following my course with Code Institute, I also took one of the challenges from the learning material and created a short video presenting the planning process.
Please, see the video published on my YouTube channel: <a href="https://youtu.be/mYHxvke3nY8">click here</a>


### **Product roadmap**
After analyzing the results of the survey and comparing them with a principles stated during the brainstorm session, I was able to create an image of Persona and the basic road map with the requirements to achieve minimum viable product.

<a href="https://prezi.com/view/jZmEUduLODT7R7EPVC5b/" target="_blank">See the results in this presentation.</a>

At this point I started to develop a product backlog in Jira, where I stated: Epics containing User Stories. Each User Story had assigned story points, tasks and a priority label based on the MoSCoW prioritisation technique.
See user stories: <a href="https://pdfhost.io/v/s87R9kjuz_User_Story">here.</a>


### **Release planning**
According to the Agile principles, I created two work sprints (cycles). I created my Sprints for the time of 2 weeks, where each week contains 30h of work, which is equal to the workforce of one part-time working developer (in this case I have assigned all the tasks to myself). Based on the story points I was able to estimate the time of each User Story and assign them into Sprints. The Story Points are equal to:

Story Points | Importance | Time
---|---|---
2p | small task | up to 2h of work
4p | middle task | up to 4h of work
8p | big task | more than 4h of work

The big task should not take more than 8h of work.


### **Sprint planning**
In the first part of work (Sprint 1) the team should deliver Minimum Variable Product, which means create a basic newsfeed page, which is accesible for a User after registration. User should be able to add, edit and delete post as well as leave the comment. The Admin panel should be customised.
The second Sprint contains adding more features like: categories, likes and MyPage (where User can see only his own posts and keep track of them). Before the second Sprint begins, the realization should be discussed with the Client and necessary changes should be added to the workflow.
As you can see on the pictures below, I have not achieve the tasks connected with comment section, therefore those tickets was added to my second Sprint.

**Jira backlog in the beggining of Sprint 1:**

</p>

### **Daily stand-ups**
This point of agile development would be necessary, if there was more than one developer working on the project. The short daily stand-up meeting helps the team accomplish their tasks by brief update on the work done and work which is planned for that day. I have been reviewing the workflow on the beginning of each day of development to keep track of the achieved tasks in comparison to the estimated time so that I could later implement the changes into a Second Sprint.

### **Sprint review and retrospective**
After the end of the First Sprint I had scheduled a meeting with my mentor to discuss the current development and seek further review or advice. Secondly I have also presented the deployed page to the clients and had another brainstorm session to discuss further development. With all the changes included in the backlog, I was then ready to begin working on the Second Sprint.

## **Implementation**

### **1. Create a basic Django project and first application**
### **2. Initial deployment**
### **3. Create Superuser**
### **4. User authentication**
### **5. Create product model and related views**
### **6. CRUD for Users**
### **7. Reviews **

<p align="center">
  <img src="#" alt="jira_sprint">
</p>


### **8. Categories**
I have created the last model for my application *(Category)* which requires only one text-input field for the name of the category. I have registered the model in my Admin section, which automatically added the desired field into the Admin Panel and granted him the possibility to create/edit and delete Category. Since Admin is the only person who has permission to add and modify categories, no extra view or form was needed to add to the application.
In order to run correct categorization, the *Category* input had to be implemented into the Post Model. I have added a dropdown menu field into my *Post Form* and set it to *required*.
Furthermore I have created a view which will get the available categories created by the Admin and render them in the dropdown menu in the *Post Form* and also in the navigation panel. Then I added a next view responsible for filtering the posts, which have a common category and displaying them in descending order in a new html file. Thanks to that, User can filter the posts by category and access the information that he is looking for.

### 11. **Extra features**

<p align="center">
  <img src="#" alt="cli">
</p>

**Add messages**
One of the useful features provided by django framework is the messages system, which gives the User feedback about the action he has taken. I have added the bootstrap classes to the default messages coming in a django package. In order to do so, I have defined the classes in the *settings.py* file. To render the message connected to a particular action, I have added the for loop into my *base.html* file, which takes all messages and renders them in the specified cases: when User add or edit the post as well as when User add the comment.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/KlaudiaBC/FST-Project-Empire-of-Thoughts/blob/main/static/images/readme/messages.png?raw=true" alt="messages">
</p>

**Customised 404 and 500 error pages.**
During the final code review with my mentor, he suggested adding my custom 404 and 500 error pages, therefore I had created a customized html file in my templates and added views (linked to urls) which are the handlers for mentioned errors.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/KlaudiaBC/FST-Project-Empire-of-Thoughts/blob/main/static/images/readme/errors.png?raw=true" alt="error pages">
</p>

**Styling**
During all the implementation process  I have been adding required styling in the front-end, based mostly on the bootstrap components, grid, forms and classes. I have also created my own css file, where I added a custom styling for all components.

### **Surface**



#### **Base (common for each page of application):**

**Logo and navbar:**
Sticky top, includes logo (left side) and the navbar on the right side (burder-menu on the mobile devices)
Menu includes following:
 - For new User: Register, Login
 - For registered Users: Home, MyPage, Category, AddPost, Logout.

<p align="center">
  <img src="#" alt="landing page desktop">
</p>

**Footer** - on the bottom of the page, contains information about the author, links to social media accounts (buttons/icons) and link to the Regulations.


<p align="center">
  <img src="#" alt="landing page mobile">
</p>

<p align="center">***</p>

#### **Content of the pages:**

Register page - contains one card with registration form and buttons to submit or to go back.

<p align="center">
  <img src="#" alt="register_page">
</p>

Login page - contains one card with login form and buttons to submit or go back.

<p align="center">
  <img src="#" alt="login_page">
</p>

Newsfeed page (Home): The posts are wrapped in the card element and displayed in descending order. Each card has the same size and contains: the category, topic, date of creation, the author, snippet of the post content. Button *"Read more"* moves the User to the detalic view of the chosen post.

<p align="center">
  <img src="#" alt="home_page">
</p>

MyPage - render the same view as the home page, but display filtered posts- only the one which was created by the User. There are two buttons added into a post card: *"Edit"* and *"Delete"*.


Detalic view page - render the: title, author, date and body of the particular post. Below there is a *"like"* button - User can like and unlike the post by clicking the *"like"* icon. Third part of the container is a comment section, where all added and approved by Admin comments are displayed in ascending order. On top of this section is located an *"Add comment"* button which render the Add Comment Form.

## **Testing**
The testing documentation is in separate file: <a href="https://github.com/KlaudiaBC/FST-Project-Empire-of-Thoughts/blob/main/TESTING.md">TESTING.md</a> 

<p align="right"><a href="#welcome">Bact to top</a></p>

## **Deployment**
1. Installing project requirements.
In the terminal run commands pip3 install (i used pip3 instead of pip - in order to specify the Python version that is used, by default it is version 2):
- Green unicorn, server used to run Django on Heroku: *gunicorn*
- PostgreSQL libraries:
*dj_database_url*
*psycopg2*

Create the *requirements.txt* via command in the terminal:
*pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt*

2. Add env.py
In the main repository create a new file called *"env.py"* in order to store sensitive information. Make sure the *env.py* file is included in the *.gitignore* file and will not be saved while the changes are committed.
(You can create the env.py file in the terminal via command: *touch env.py*)

In the *env.py file*: import operating system (os) and add following variables: *SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL*.
In *settings.py* find a variable called *SECRET_KEY* and cut its value. Paste the value into *env.py*.
Then in the *settings.py* refer to this value via function: *os.environ.get()*

3. Create a heroku app via CLI.
- At first, you have to create an account on *Herokuapp*.
- Next step is to install the heroku CLI in Gitpod and login into your Heroku account via command: *heroku login -i*
- In order to create an app, follow the command:
*heroku apps:create my_appname*
In order to set the region to EU, add to the command: *--region eu*
Otherwise, by default the region will be set to US.

4. Create a database on Heroku.
- In the *"Resources"* Tab find *"Heroku Postgres"* and add it to your app.
- Go to *"Settings"*, click on: *"Reveal Vars"* and copy the value of *DATABASE_URL* key.
- Go back to your workspace. In the *env.py* file paste value into the variable *DATABASE_URL*.
- In the *settings.py* file: comment out the *DATABASE* settings and set the *DATABASE* to the Postgres database accessible via *DATABASE_KEY*
- import *dj_database_urls*
- run migrations
You will see that all the migrations are happening because of the database connection. Now the project is using the Heroku database as backend.

5. Prepare your environment
- From the *env.py* copy the value of *SECRET_KEY* variable.
- Go to Herokuapp --> Settings/ reveal and add the following Vars:
SECRET_KEY (value: paste)
HEROKU_HOSTNAME - the url of your heroku app
PORT - 8000
DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC - give it value of 1 in order to get the empty project running as if there are no static files at the moment of initial deployment (later this variable must be removed).

6. Create a Procfile
In the *Procfile* (make sure the name is starting with capital letter) you need to specify the commands that are executed by the app on startup. In this case, it is:  *web: gunicorn empire_blog.wsgi*

7. Commit and push.
In my case, that was the first commit since creating the Django project. In other cases, I would have to make some changes which would allow me to run the push command.
- Commit all changes.
- Push the commit into: origin main
- Push the commit into: heroku main

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/KlaudiaBC/FST-Project-Empire-of-Thoughts/blob/main/static/images/readme/deploy_cli.png?raw=true" alt="cli">
</p>

8. At this stage your app should be correctly deployed on Herokuapp.

9. Connect Github to Heroku
In order to avoid deploying changes in the terminal twice, you can connect your project on Heroku to your Gitpod.
In order to do so - in the *"Deploy"* tab scroll down and click the button *"Connect to GitHub"*. Then set: *deploy automatically*. You can also disable automatic deployment and run your deployment manually at your own chosen time.

10. Final deployment
Before the application will be handeled to the client in the realise 1.0 stage, there are two very important steps to be taken:
- detele DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from your confiv VARS in Heroku
- in the setting.py file, set the **DEBUG=False** in order to protect sensitive information - IMPORTANT!

By now your app should be ready and running.
Unless your Django project will not read the staticfiles with the Debug set to *False*.
See how to handle that in the TESTING.md file / Errors and bugs.
